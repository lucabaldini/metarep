This is an unusual repo. From the pure code standpoint it provides a single |Python| module
exposing exactly one function. (The latter calculates the square of a given number or
numpy array, in case you do care.)

In the process, though, we touch upon many different points related to the development and
maintainance of a simple Python package, and the underlying repository can be taken as a
rough template and a starting point for new projects.
